# Data-Science

All the works in this repository were carried out during the postgraduate studies in Data Science. These projects covered a range of subjects, highlighting the diverse skills and knowledge gained during the program.

In the module on statistical inference, we delved into analyzing flight delays, examining patterns and drawing insightful conclusions. 

The applied data science project centered around the Titanic dataset, presenting an opportunity to implement data science techniques in a real-world context. 

Python played a pivotal role in the analysis of flight delays, showcasing its versatility and power in handling large datasets and performing complex computations. 

The data collection methodologies module equipped us with proficiency in SQL and API's.

Exploratory data analysis was important for understanding the data details and finding meaningful insights with visualizations.

The fundamentals of machine learning module provided a solid foundation, enabling the application of machine learning techniques to practical problems.

Lastly, the operationalization of machine learning module emphasized the importance of deploying models into production.

Overall, this repository reflects the comprehensive and multifaceted nature of the Data Science postgraduate program, demonstrating proficiency in statistical analysis, data collection, applied data science, exploratory data analysis, programming with Python, machine learning fundamentals, and the practical deployment of machine learning models.
